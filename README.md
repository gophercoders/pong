## Pong the GopherCoders.com Code Club Version

A reimplementation of the classic Atari game [PONG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).

This code is not idiomatic Go. Nor does it claim to be an ideal version of
Pong, in terms of it's design or implementation.

The code is intended as project for the Gopher Coders Code Clubs beyond
the basic course. The project is intended to allow pupils to explore the ideas
of problem decomposition and program design.

In terms of the programs implementation it introduces the ideas of constants,
boolean logic, functions and parameters, switch statements and arrays. The
program also introduces pointers to a very minor extent.

### Dependencies
